 Ring 3 Kernel

 Copyright (C) 2006-2009 Mike McCormack

About
-----

This project aims to load the userspace of an NT system
into a user space controlled by a usermode kernel.

Why?
----

There are several aims for this project:

* understand how the Windows kernel-userland interface works
* provide an alternate method of virtualization
* reduce the scope of reimplementation as compared to Wine
* make application's address space indistinguishable from native Windows
* move closed and non-free code out of ring 0

Requirements
------------

* A Linux (tm) 2.6.x kernel patches applied.
* A Windows 2000 (tm) CD
* libSDL 1.2
* the mingw cross compiler (for tests)
* glibc with the NPTL version of pthreads
* gcc, g++ 4.2.1 or so
* libxml2 (for registry code)
* cabextract (extract windows cab files)
* isoinfo from http://cdrecord.berlios.de (read the CD)
* On x86-64, the compiler should be able to generate 32-bit code
  (Debian users should install gcc-multilib, g++-multilib, ia32-libs)

Instructions
------------

To run smss.exe, from the top level directory, do:

./configure
make
ln -s /path/to/your/win2k.iso
make test
./ring3k

To run a test (for example the semaphore test):

./runtest sema

To run all the working tests, do:

make test


Debugging ring3k using gdb
--------------------------

As ring3k uses ptrace, it interferes with gdb.  You can still debug 
ring3k coredumps as follows:

 $ ulimit -c unlimited
 # echo "core-%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern 
 # echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid 
 $ ring3k --trace=core

If ring3k crashes, two core files will be generated, one for ring3k-client
and one for ring3k-bin.  You can load them alternately into gdb as follows:

 $ gdb --core=core-1234
 (gdb) symbol-file kernel/ring3k-bin


Files
-----
kernel/     - implementation of the userspace kernel
libudis86/  - the udis86 disassembler
libmspack/  - code to extract files from the windows install disk
tests/      - test cases that run on both NT and the loader
tools/      - a collection of windows executables
documents/  - a few notes

Development
-----------

Development of new code and bug fixes should be done with test cases.
The test case should show how Windows functions, and should test the code
that has been written as much as possible.

Coding style for kernel C++

```
class CLASS_NAME
{
	ULONG m_Member;
	VOID InitializeSomeData();
}
```

In case the class name conflicts with the Win32/NT typename, then the name should be prefixed with C, like CBITMAP


Using QEMU to run tests
-----------------------

Optionally, install kqemu

One time setup:

1. Create a 2G sparse disk image:
    dd if=/dev/null of=win2k.img bs=1024 seek=2M

2  Install Windows 2000:
    qemu -hda win2k.img -cdrom win2k.iso -boot d -m 64

3. Run QEMU:

	make qemu

   OR

	qemu -hda win2k.img -cdrom nttest.iso -m 64

4. To run a test, login and start cmd.exe.  To run the thread test, type:

	d:
	hostnt thread.exe

5. If you wish to rebuild a test case, do:

	make
	make cdrom

   To use the new ISO in QEMU, press <ALT><CTRL>2, to switch to the QEMU
   console and type:

	eject cdrom

   You need to make windows notice that there's no disk in the drive first by.
   Do this by pressing <ALT><CTRL>1, and try run the test case by up arrowing
   to hostnt thread.exe then pressing <ENTER>.  When you get a message box
   saying "There is no disk in drive...", switch back to the console using
   <ALT><CTRL>2, and type:

	change cdrom nttest.iso

   Then <ALT><CTRL>1 back to Windows and select "Try Again"
   by up arrowing twice on the dialog and pressing enter.


Starting minitris.exe or pixels.exe on a Windows 2000 QEMU image
----------------------------------------------------------------

Assume you have a windows 2000 install on QEMU in a file named win2k.img,
you can copy minitris.exe over the winlogon.exe on there and it will run
when the image is booted.

Mount the Windows 2000 disk image (as root):

    mount -o loop,offset=32256 win2k.img /mnt/

Backup winlogon.exe:

    cp -i /mnt/winnt/system32/winlogon.exe /mnt/winnt/system32/_winlogon.exe

Replace winlogon.exe:

    cp -i ring3k/tools/minitris.exe /mnt/winnt/system32/winlogon.exe

Unmount the Windows 2000 disk image:

    umount /mnt

Run QEMU (as user, making sure you have umount'ed the image first!)

    qemu -hda win2k.img
